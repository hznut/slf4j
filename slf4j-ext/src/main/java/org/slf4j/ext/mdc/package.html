      <h1>Structured MDC (SMDC)</h1>
      <p>This implementation uses the same inherited thread local concept that MDC implementations use internally.
        In org.slf4j.MDC both key and value can only be of String type. This implementation allows you to store different
        data types (normally the ones you'll see in Json) in <i>structure</i> of your choice not just a flat key-value map.


        POJO tree for storing event information local to current thread's context i.e. thread local.
        Many production systems these days capture and log events as Json Eg. Click/impression events on websites/Ads.
